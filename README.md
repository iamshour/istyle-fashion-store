🚧 P.S. App is still under construction...<br />

## App Info ℹ️

Full Stack E-commerce webapp built with Next.js, in adition to CRUD functionalities for both Admins (adding/editing/deleting products with an admin dashboard), and for Users as well (Viewing products, adding a product to cart/favorites tab, editing profile, purchasing products using Stripe.js, receiving transaction emails, etc...) Fully designed and developed by me! Built mainly with Next.js and its built-in APIs handling, in addition to using MongoDb, Next-auth for handling authentication, react hooks, SASS preprocessor, and react-Bootstrap for the carousel slider.

## App Idea 💡

I've created this app on my free time as a side project. The app is using Mock data to simulate a real E-commerce shopping app, while I was inspired by many similar E-commerce apps to produce this modern UI and functionality. I tend to work on many side projects on my free time to keep a refreshed memory, while it's also a lot of fun! If you like what I do, hit me up & lets chat!
